There are more than one axiomatizations of set theory. The most famous one might be Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). But, due to ZFC's exclusion of proper classes, the formal descriptions of many things become convoluted. So, in this blog, we invoke **Morse-Kelly set theory** (**MK**), which is a proper expansion of ZFC.

## Primitive notions in MK

In MK, there are only two primitive notions: **class** and **membership**.

Intuitively, a class is a collection of objects. But, as classes are the only primitive objects in MK, a class is a collection of classes. Every letters, $x$, $y$, $z$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$, ... but $M$, denotes a class.

Membership, denoted by $\in$, is a relation between classes. The notation $x \in y$ means $x$ is an **element** or a **member** of $y$.

**Set**, however, is not a primitive notion in MK. Instead, we define the monadic predicate $M(x)$ as
$$
\forall x \; (M(x) \iff \exists y\; (x \in y)),
$$
and call every class $x$ satisfying $M(x)$ as a **set**. So, in MK, element and set is a pair of equivalent concepts. In this sense, set is a definable concept in MK. This may not be a reassuring answer, but it is true.

In any theory $T$, for define a term $t$, we must show that the objects or relation $[t]$ indicated by $t$ exists in $T$; otherwise, $t$ is undefinable. So, 

$$
t \text{ is defined in } T \implies [t] \text{ exists in } T.
$$

If $t$ is a primitive notion, then $t$ is not only defined, but also **assumed as defined** - only its explicit definition does not exist in $T$. In this case, the existence of $[t]$ cannot be proven in $T$, but assumed to be true; otherwise, $t$ is a primitive notion indicates objects does not exist in $T$. This is paradoxical.

For this reason, in MK, the existence of classes and membership are assumed; they are "axioms" without explicit statement in the theory.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Existence of classes:} & \exists x\; (x = x); \\
&\text{Existence of Membership:} & \exists x\; \exists y\; (x \in y);
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the existence of elements is a straight consequence of the set of primitive notions. And, as terms, element and set, indicate the same objects, set is defined as element.

Those classes which are not set are called **proper class**. But, note that we can define proper classes so far, because the necessary axiom is not introduced yet.

Subclass is another concept that can be straightly derived from the postulations of primitive notions, because, at least, by the property of $=$, we have
$$
x = x \implies \forall z\; (z \in x \implies z \in z),
$$
namely, $x \subseteq x$.

But, note that the definition of proper subclasses cannot be derived from the above postulations. If $x$ is a proper subclass of $y$, i.e., $x \subset y$, then $x \subseteq y$ and $x \ne y$. But, with the absence of necessary axioms, we cannot even sure that if there are any distinct classes; i.e.,
$$
\exists x\; \exists y\; (x \ne y).
$$


## Fundamental properties of classes

There are eight axioms in MK. Each of them, we'll see, is independent from others. This is why I personally prefer to MK rather than some versions of ZFC (for example, the version on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory)). In this chapter, I introduce three of MK-axioms, which represents the fundamental idea of the axiomatization of set theory.

The axiom of class comprehension is the only axiom schema in MK-axiom. Here is a simple word of why it is called an axiom schema. Once a statement is called a schema, it actually includes arbitrarily many statements in the same pattern. Take axiom schema of class comprehension for example. If our language is restricted in the first-order logic, this axiom cannot be completely described, as the expression $\forall \phi(x)$ is not allowed in first-order logic. So, in the formal expression, $\phi(\cdot)$ serves as a placeholder for predicates.

Class-builder notation, namely, describing set in the form $A = \{x: P(x)\}$, is a useful tool to reduce the length of discussion. This notation is straightforwardly derived from the axiom schema of class comprehension with the axiom of extensionality.

> \forall u \; (P(u) \iff (u = x \lor u = y \lor u = z) ).

By the axiom schema of class comprehension, there is a class $R = \{x: x \notin x\land M(x)\}$, and it is a straight corollary that $R$ is not a set, i.e., $\neg M(x)$, for $M(R)$ raises Russell's paradox. So, in MK, proper class exist - at least, we have $R$.

> [!definition]
> 
> #### Proper classes
> 
> A class $x$ is a **proper class** if and only if it is not a set, i.e., $\neg M(x)$.

As MK is a first-order logic axiomatization of set theory, by the axiom schema of class comprehension, every predicate $P(x)$ written in the terms of $\neg$, $\forall$, $\lor$, $($, $)$, $\in$, with sets, $x$, $y$, $x$, ... constructs a class. ($\exists$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, etc., can be derived from other first-order logic symbols). If a class $A$ is only constructed from a single set $x$, then we say $A$ is constructed from $x$, or $x$-constructible. For example, $\emptyset$, $\{\emptyset\}$, and $\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}$ is $\emptyset$-constructible. Later, we will discuss why these classes are sets.

But, note that, the axiom schema of class comprehension only gives predicates a chance to construct a class (by axiom of extensionality, this class is unique), but, it does not guarantee that every class $A$ can be written as $A = \{x: P(x)\}$. So, are there any indescribable class $A$? Neither MK, ZFC, nor NBG gives us an answer for this - it is unsure. So, it is note worthy that, when proving set theoretical theorems, we shall always avoid stating sentences like "(given an arbitrary class $A$,) let $P(x)$ be a predicate such that $A = \{x: P(x)\}$." In set theory, it is not guaranteed that every set is constructible.

There are many definitions can be derived from the above two axioms:

1. **Arbitrary union**, namely, $\bigcup A$ whereas $A$ is a class;
2. **Arbitrary intersection**, namely, $\bigcap A$ where as $A$ is a class;
3. **Unordered pair**, namely, the class in the form of $\{x,y\}$ whereas $x$ and $y$ are sets;
4. **Empty class**, denoted by $\emptyset$, which can be obtained by $\emptyset = \{x: x \ne x\}$;
5. **Universal class**, or **universe**, $\mathscr U = \{x : M(x)\}$.

The above definitions are well-known, so I do not elaborate further here. However, there is a noteworthy fact related to these definitions: the objects defined above are classes. None of the axioms above guarantees that any of them to be a set. Indeed, some of them are sets in MK, but they are guaranteed by other MK-axioms.

> [!definition]
> 
> #### Successors
> 
> Let $x$ be a set. The **successor** of $x$, denoted by $x^+$, is defined as the class
> 
> $$
> x^+ = x \cup \{x\}.
> $$

Similar to the definitions above, none of the axioms we have so far guarantees that $x^+$ must be a set. But, as a type of classes, this definition can be derived from the axiom of extensionality and the axiom schema of class comprehension:

Let $x$ be a set, then $\{x\} = \{y: y = x\}$ is a class. Let $P(u)$ be a predicate be defined as
$$
\forall u \; (P(u) \iff u \in x \lor u = x).
$$
Then, there is a class
$$
\{ u : u \in x \lor u = x \} = x \cup \{x\}.
$$
And, by the notation in the definition of successor, $x^+ = x \cup \{x\}$.

> [!statement]
> 
> #### Axiom of regularity
> 
> For any non-empty class $x$, there is an element $y \in x$ satisfying $x \cap y = \emptyset$.

It is a straight corollary that $x \notin x$ for any set $x$. Aiming for a contradiction, suppose there is a set $x \in x$. By the axiom schema of class comprehension, there is a class $\{x\} = \{u: u = x\}$, and $x \in \{x\}$ as $x = x$. As $x \in x$ and $x \in \{x\}$, we have $x \in x \cap \{x\}$. As $x$ is the only element in $\{x\}$, the axiom of regularity is contradicted.

Thus, there are many distinct sets in the universe $\mathscr U$; i.e.,

$$
\exists x\; \exists y\; (x \ne y),
$$

because, at least, we have $x \ne \{x\}$. If we invoke natural numbers, then, the above axioms bring us infinitely many sets in the universe. For example, for any natural number $n$, let

$$
x_n := \underbrace{\left\{
\cdots \underbrace{\left\{ \underbrace{ \{x_0\} }_{x_1} \right\}}_{x_2} \cdots
\right\}}_{x_n}
$$

Then, for any natural numbers $j$ and $k$, if $j \ne k$, then $x_i \ne x_k$.

Another consequence of this is that the universe $\mathscr U = \{x: M(x)\}$ is a proper class. Because, if it is a set, then $M(\mathscr U)$ implies $\mathscr U \in \mathscr U$, contradicting the axiom of regularity.

Is it possible that $x \in x$ if $x$ is a proper class other than $\mathscr U$? In MK, this can be proven without invoking the axiom of regularity. Let $x$ be a proper class. If $x \in x$, then the property $M(x)$ is satisfied, contradicting the definition of proper class.
